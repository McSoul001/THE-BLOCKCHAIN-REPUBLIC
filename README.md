# THE-BLOCKCHAIN-REPUBLIC

## INTRODUCTION: "ESCAPE ROUTES"

1. Block and Chain are words loaded with slavery connotations as in the 'striatted' agricultural/mining landfield/squarified urban aglomeration/barcoding/jailing.

2. Currently the term refers to ledgers for transactions within a mass datification process: 
absolutely everything including volume of air inhaled, daily composition of the human excrement and all sort of medical, intelectual, productivity variables correlated to enviromental, cultural and dietary factors are being milked/to/exhaustion in order to amplify generational priviledges of the ultra high-net-worth individuals. 

3. A sort of parent ledger would be needed to register all the data since confirmed pregnacy until legal/biological death (disposition of the corpse and distribution of the belongings of the person who just passed).  

4. This is a template for a dystopian control system based on algorithms.  

5. The idea is to signal escape routes to the ongoing/natural corporative/monopolistic tendencies.

## FIRST PART: "EVERY COUNTRY ON THE PLANET WORKS AS A LABORATORY FARM"

6. We killed all the other hominids and spread across the world due to be constantly forced to exile by militar sedentarists. 

7. The world has been working like islands divided by farms. 

8. The "current" dilemma went worse with the taxation to military subordinated territories (robbery) exemplified in the Akkadian empire. 

9. Every "capital/provinces" system implies inneficient boureaucracy and corruption: basically a colonial model.

10. The present proposed republic is a trans-continental format of interconnected metropolitan areas organized by commuting patterns.

.
## SECOND PART: "NO POPULAR ELECTION"

11. The project of an enciclopedic republic, guided by the illustration, was naturally controlled from the beginning by the sponsoring 'affluents' and corporations (nowdays). 

12. The popular election is highly inefficient due to the lack of coordination between science, tax collection and budget execution. 

13. Notice than politics is the only area of human interaction where a generalist is choosen to do a very specific job which, outside of this irrational model, would be considered absurd: the best example would be to chose by popular election the person performing an open heart surgery.

14. Models for evaluating standarized good governance were never thought until now when artificial inteligence is exceling humans in every single imaginable category. 

15. The ideal template of a goverment management would imply the final goal of zero public officers: Automation. 

16. It is our responsibility as ideologists to study every country/farm and select/handpick from them the best proven policies (one by one) to construct a republic with the best features of existing republics and added features currently yet to be implemented.

.
## THIRD PART: "A TRANSITORY MODEL-A SCHOLASTIC/GENERATIONAL/MERITOCRATIC TECHNOCRACY"

17. The fudamental principle of the republic is the elimination of popular election and the impossibility of appointing others to public roles.

18. The final objective is to prevent structuraly that any individual with delirium of grandeur would be able to seize power. 

19. In order to do so, we have created a series of positions organized in ascending grades and generationally. 

20. Every position respond to a career path, can be only held once and it is not possible to enter another public branch. 

21. Initial public positions require that the candidates have already undergone a generation (19 years) of experience in the private sector, but this experience just starting being accrued after reaching 19 years old (the legal age to enter adulthood). 

22. For practical purposes one generation is divided in four periods (The number of years a position would be held before being promoted or finalizing the public service).
 
23. 19 years represents a cycle of the sun and moon approximate reset and an approximated middle point to adulthood in several countries.

## FOURTH PART: "ENVIRONMENTALLY ORIENTED SUSTAINABLE GOVERNANCE"

24. The republic aim to extend the concept of 'kind' into a wider perspective, challenging traditional restricted models where only other selected humans are considered as such in relation to their proximity in terms of biological evolutionary kingdom, country of origin, race, gender, age, religious, political and sport affiliations.

25. The hyerarchical order of rights starts with the clean water and air being the top priority of any policy, followed by natural parks, native animals, plants, indigenous peoples and farmers.

.
## THE 'PARIS AGREEMENT' MADE A MATHEMATICAL FORMULA FOR TAXATION/INCENTIVES
Things that work on scientific basis, like vaning the use of lead in the gasoline or the usage of Chlorofluorocarbons are the best examples on how coordination on proven facts is possible and necessary. 

44. Geographical areas would be ecologically alighned to river basins. Tributary river systems serve to track responsibilities and compensations to the city states inmediate under them regarding the plastic and chemical polution in the water. 

For example: Uganda must pay South Sudan, for the polution discharged in the Nile, while South Sudan and Ethiopia, must pay Sudan for the pollution discharged in the Nile and at the same time, Sudan must compensate Egypt for the pollution discharged, while Egypt must pay the other territories for the pollution discharged to the mediterranean sea. 

The amount to be paid will represent the exact amount that it would cost to heal the damages.

.
## CORPORATIVE STRUCTURES: "ANTI MONOPOLISTIC LAWS"

26. In the same way that crypto currencies deal with the accumulation of power in validators by progressively reducing the rewards, corporation would be planned as unprofitable to grow further than a certain point. 

27.Companies can't auction more than 49% of their equity as funding strategy and therefore 51% should always remain creditable to the employees proportional to their contributions.

28. Once you leave the company your equity will be transferred to the public shares and the correponding internal shares will be burned in order to rebalance the equity among the updated employees. 

29. Any person participating in the production of any product or service gets paid in equity and royalties proportionally according to their contributions. 

30. Your royalties last during all your lifetime and can't be alienated.

31. Once you have died, the royalties and patent rights, goes to the entire human population, configuring a minimum salary background for everyone in the republic.

.
## COPYRIGHTS, INDUSTRIAL AND DESIGN PATENTS ARE LINKED TO THE CREATOR VIA BLOCKCHAIN
Nobody would be able to transfer or sell this rights. 

Corporations can't own patents, only individuals can do and they last a lifetime. after passing, the patent charges will be still being collected and distributed to the remaining total population. 

Creators are paid in royalties, revenue commission and other residuals proportionate to their contributions.

.
## TAXES

32. No income tax. 

33. All revenue are collected via spending (Value Added Tax):

34. Taxation will be executed according to the enviromental and health impacts of the supply chain/operation of the companies/transactions. 

35. For example: a company selling packaged food would have to pay for both the sugar (or sweetened) content (and all other ingredientes linked to health diseases), the plastic used in the wrapping and the impact of the transportation from raw materials to consumer. 

36. A transportation company and factories have to pay for the gas emitions, of its operations, etc. 

37. This tax would be then be transferred to the customer via a taxation on the "livecycle assessment" (an improved/more detailed alternative to the 'food miles'). 

38. Recreational drugs like smartphones, alcohol, cigarretes, sugar and cannabis are legal and taxed in a way that is sustainable and proportionate to the health system/managing the implications of its usage. 

39. Fines: traffic fines, like speeding and other traffic violations and court fines, must be calculated based on the salary of the violator. 

40. Custom tax under the Harmmonized tariff system. 
-
.
## SERVICES TAX

39. There's a progressive taxation system/subsidy: minimul vital amount of water essential as drinking water 3,7 liters plus 7,3 liters needed to flush the toilet would be free per person in every household. 

40. Greater amount consumption would be taxed at a greater rate.   
-
.
## PROPERTY TAX: "Base of the concept of life state" 

40. Every citizen pays zero tax for the place where he lives, represented in his own one bedroom, one bathroom, one kitchen and dinning room. 

Entry level housing, usually apartments used by young adults single college students or widowed pensioners.

Couple housing is an intermediate level of housing where rights are legally splitted bewteen the dwellers and constitute de facto financial partnership during the rental time. 

Family housing is the ultimate, larger protected ownership strategy including a backward, garage and garden.

The system is planned as a live/cycle of natural upsizing and downsizing proportions. 

Special considerations have been taken in order to grant medical attention to the last months of pregnancy and elders. 


the size of this residencial property exempt from taxes is determined by the "the median size of a lot for new construction". 

41. The taxes increase by 10% progressively with the number of properties owned, up to 9 properties, where the taxation reached 90%, making the investment practicaly inprofitable. 

43. Every residential rental is considered de facto rent-to-own in benefit of the person renting. 

42. Corporations can't own houses neither they can own industrial or agricultural land, they can only rent it, being the most profitable strategy to rent it directly from several of its employees or investors, as the first property owned by them outside of their residencial houses. 


 The intention behind these policies is to focus the attention of investors in financing start ups as a road towards wealth. 
 
 Accounting must be public on a daily basis and its expenses should be included in the operational expenses of the company. 

In the republic the companies follow a tripartite ownership model: at the same time Capitalists (48% is granted as non voting shares to investors), state owned (1% owned by the state accounting service) and private (51% is owned by the employees of the company proportionate to their contributions and every employee is the facto share holder).

.
## COUNTER TAXATION:

45. Financial payments will be granted for processing neighboors organic leftovers, plastics, glass, metals, electronics, etc. 
-
.
## EXECUTIVE BRANCH
46. The fundamental training for all professional private administrators is essential to guarantee that, only those with the experience (19 years) AND the vocation, study and apply for the starting positions as local public administrators. 
 
47. The local district position as local Major is granted to those reaching the highest scores among the other candidates. 

48. The best Majors and Governors are also progressively promoted towards a wider geographical area until one reaches the position as President (Head of the State) of the city/territory. 

49. The administrators that are not selected to promotion end their public career and should resume the administration of private enterprises.

50. In order to guarantee that the best Public Officer is selected, Artificial Inteligence would be used to develop and standarise a scoring system that compensate evenly the several variables involved in governing different geographical, sociological and economical areas.

.
## RELEASING THE BUDGET 
51.Publicly disclosed smart contracts based on locked resources creditable only to publicly disclosed purchases in open bids. 
-
.
## LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
Lower camera: Scientific specialists:
52. Legislators must be commitees (3, 5 or 7 members?) of professors/researchers in each specific area to be regulated, particularly experts in quantitatible research and conducting sample implementations before proposing laws that must be peer reviewed. 

53. In the same manner of the executive role, legislative officers are not popularly elected but promoted within a generational scoring system of performance. 

54. Executive and legislative profesionals must be directly correlated/mirrored branches, therefore for a minister of transportation there must be a commission of transportation in a congress of specialist, etc. 
-
.
## Upper camera: Professionals on statistics. 

55. A council, (3, 5, 7 members?) group of profesionals in quantitatible research, correlated variables and statistics will re-study the proposed laws  in order to forecast the implications to the general public; considering multidisciplinary crossed effects of the other areas. 

56. Such positions are optained by a public career in the field, via progressive promotion.
