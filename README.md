# THE-BLOCKCHAIN-REPUBLIC

Block and Chain are words loaded with slavery connotations as in the 'striatted' agricultural/mining landfield/squarified urban aglomeration/barcoding/jailing.
Currently the term refers to ledgers for data/transfers within a mass datification process: 
absolutely everything including volume of air inhaled, daily composition of the human excrement and all sort of medical, intelectual, productivity correlated with enviromental and dietary factors will be milked/to/exhaustion. 
A 'sort of' excel/blockchain would be needed to register all these data/transactions since confirmed pregnacy until legal/biological death.  


This is a template for a dystopian ledger/control system and, by extension, a way to perpetuate the priviledges of the ultra high-net-worth individuals. 
The idea is to generate enough traction to signal escape routes to the natural corporative/monopolistic tendencies of these predictions. 

FIRST PART: "EVERY COUNTRY ON THE PLANET WORKS AS A LABORATORY FARM".

We have this mass murder monster inside of us, that's why we killed all the other hominids and spread across the world in the first place. 
Not because romantic venturing, but constantly being forced to exile by militar sedentarists. 
The world has been working like islands divided by farms. 
The "current" dilemma went worse with the taxation to subordinated farms (robbery) exemplified in the Akkadian empire. 
Every "capital/provinces" system implies inneficient boureaucracy and corruption.

An interconected world of households, city-states (organized by communting patterns) and continents would offer the most efficient administrative.


The project of an enciclopedic republic, guided by the illustration, was naturally controlled from the beginning by the sponsoring 'affluents' and corporations (nowdays). 
The popular election failed due to the lack of coordination between science, tax collection and budget execution. 
Notice than politics in the only area of human interaction where a generalist is choosen to do a very specific job which, outside of this paranoid model, would be considered absurd. 
The best example would be, the person chosen to represent a country in the 100 meters competition.

The ideal template of a goverment management would imply the goal of zero public officers. 
Automation. 


Therefore the farms are currently a system of linear exploitation to perpetuate stability within archaic models of supremasy and titulage while at the same time keep as many 'undesirable' people as possible outside of the borders.    
Outsiders, are useful as consultants/producers and consumers, but not as peers. 
The concept of 'kind' is as restricted as possible in terms of country of origin, race, gender, age, religious, political and sport affiliations.
This goes with the fact that people are forced to identify themselves within these categories despite not wanting to be labeled or disminished.
The restriction of the view points is essential: the animals being killed, the indigenous peoples being killed and the local environmental activists being killed must be censored and silenced in order to keep the streamline model working. 
Algorythms are used to maximize the time spent under entertaintment. 

A CAREER MODEL
When we focus on gobernance we talk about positions.
Every position can be only held once. 


THE OPPOSITE OF THE DISNEY MODEL

Imagine all the team in the production of a movie or videogame (including extras, cleaning and security personal) gets paid in equity and loyalties proportionally according to their contributions. 


An economic model debt free.

Your loyalties last during all your lifetime and they can't be alienated.

Companies can't alienate more than 49% of their equity as funding strategy and therefore 51% should always remain creditable to the employees proportional to their contributions.
