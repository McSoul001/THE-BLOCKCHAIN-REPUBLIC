# THE-BLOCKCHAIN-REPUBLIC

INTRODUCTION

1. Block and Chain are words loaded with slavery connotations as in the 'striatted' agricultural/mining landfield/squarified urban aglomeration/barcoding/jailing.

2. Currently the term refers to ledgers for data/transfers within a mass datification process: 
absolutely everything including volume of air inhaled, daily composition of the human excrement and all sort of medical, intelectual, productivity variables correlated to enviromental, cultural and dietary factors will be milked/to/exhaustion. 

3. A 'sort of' excel/blockchain would be needed to register all these data/transactions since confirmed pregnacy until legal/biological death (disposition of the corpse and distribution of the belongings of the person who just passed).  

4. This is a template for a dystopian ledger/control system and, by extension, a way to perpetuate the priviledges of the ultra high-net-worth individuals. 

5. The idea is to generate enough traction to signal escape routes to the natural corporative/monopolistic tendencies of these predictions. 


FIRST PART: "EVERY COUNTRY ON THE PLANET WORKS AS A LABORATORY FARM".

6. We killed all the other hominids and spread across the world due to be constantly forced to exile by militar sedentarists. 

7. The world has been working like islands divided by farms. 

8. The "current" dilemma went worse with the taxation to military subordinated farms (robbery) exemplified in the Akkadian empire. 

9. Every "capital/provinces" system implies inneficient boureaucracy and corruption: basically a colonial model.

10. Additionally the project of an enciclopedic republic, guided by the illustration, was naturally controlled from the beginning by the sponsoring 'affluents' and corporations (nowdays). 

11. The popular election failed due to the lack of coordination between science, tax collection and budget execution. 

12. Notice than politics is the only area of human interaction where a generalist is choosen to do a very specific job which, outside of this irrational model, would be considered absurd: the best example would be, the person chosen to represent a country in the 100 meters race competition or performing an open heart surgery (being chosen by popular election).

13. The problem is that models for evaluating standarized good governance were never thought until now when artificial inteligence is exceling humans in every single imaginable category. 

14. The ideal template of a goverment management would imply the final goal of zero public officers: Automation. 

15. It is our responsibility as ideologists to study every country/farm and select/handpick from them the best proven policies (one by one) to construct a republic with the best features of existing republics and added features currently yet to be implemented. 


FIRST PART II: A TRANSITORY MODEL-A SCHOLASTIC/GENERATIONAL/MERITOCRATIC TECHNOCRACY.

17. The fudamental principle of the republic is the elimination of popular election and the impossibility of appointing others to public roles.

18. The final objective is to prevent structuraly that any individual with delirium of grandeur would be able to seize power. 

19. In order to do so, we have created a series of positions organized in ascending grades and generationally. 

20. Every position can be only held once and it is not possible to enter another public position without starting from the beginning. 

21. Initial public positions require that the candidates have already undergone a generation (19 years) of experience in the private sector, but this experience just starting being accrued after reaching 19 years old (the legal age to enter adulthood). 

22. For practical purposes one generation is divided in four periods (The number of years a position would be held before being promoted or finalizing the public service).
 
23. 19 years represents a cycle of the sun and moon approximate reset and an approximated middle point to adulthood in several countries.  

SECOND PART: A REPUBLIC THOUGHT AS ENVIRONMENTALLY ORIENTED SUSTAINABLE GOVERNANCE

24. The republic aim to extend the concept of 'kind' into a wider perspective, challenging traditional restricted models where only other selected humans are considered as such in relation to their proximity in terms of biological evolutionary kingdom, country of origin, race, gender, age, religious, political and sport affiliations.

25. The hyerarchical order of rights starts with the clean water and air being the top priority of any policy, followed by natural parks, native animals, plants and indigenous peoples.  


CORPORATIVE STRUCTURES PART 1: ANTI MONOPOLISTIC LAWS:

26. In the same way that crypto currencies deal with the accumulation of power in validators by progressively reducing the rewards, corporation would be planned as unprofitable to grow further than a certain point. 

27. All the team in the production of a movie or videogame (including extras, cleaning and security personal) gets paid in equity and royalties proportionally according to their contributions. 

28. Your royalties last during all your lifetime and can't be alienated.

29. Once you have died, the royalties goes to the entire human population, configuring a minimum salary background for everyone in the republic. 

30.Companies can't auction more than 49% of their equity as funding strategy and therefore 51% should always remain creditable to the employees proportional to their contributions.

31. Once you leave the company your equity will be transferred to the public shares and the correponding internal shares will be burned in order to rebalance the equity among the updated employees. 

TAXES

32. No income tax. 

33. All revenue are collected via spending (Value Added Tax):

34. Taxation will be executed according to the enviromental and health impacts of the supply chain/operation of the company. 

35. For example: a company selling packaged food would have to pay for both the sugar (or sweetened) content (and all other ingredientes linked to health diseases) and the plastic used in the wrapping. 

36. A transportation company would have to pay for the gas emitions, etc. 

37. This tax would be then be transferred to the customer  via a taxation on the "livecycle assessment" (an improved/more detailed alternative to the 'food miles'). 

38. Recreational drugs, alcohol, cigarretes and sugar are legal and taxed in a way that is sustainable and proportionate to the health system/managing the implications of its usage. 

SERVICES TAX

39. There's a progressive taxation system/subsidy: minimul vital amount of water essential as drinking water 3,7 liters plus 7,3 liters needed to flush the toilet would be free per person in every household. Greater amount consumption would be taxed at a greater rate.   

PROPERTY TAX

40. Every citizen pays zero tax for the place where he lives, represented in his own one bedroom, one bathroom, one kitchen, one garage, one garden, one dinning room, one garden and a backward. 

41. The taxes increase progressively with the number of houses owned, up to a number where the taxation makes the investment inprofitable. 

42. Corporations can't own houses. 

43. Every rental is considered de facto rent-to-own.

THE 'PARIS AGREEMENT' MADE A MATHEMATICAL FORMULA FOR TAXATION/INCENTIVES
Things that work on scientific basis, like vaning the use of lead in the gasoline or the usage of Chlorofluorocarbons are the best examples on how coordination on proven facts is possible and necessary. 

44. Geographic areas would be ecologically alighned to tributary river systems, where city states are responsible to pay compensation to the city states inmediate under them regarding the plastic and chemical polution in the water. 

COUNTER TAXATION:
45. Financial payments will be granted for processing neighboors organic leftovers, plastics, glass, metals, electronics, etc. 

EXECUTIVE BRANCH
46. The fundamental training for all professional private administrators is essential to guarantee that, only those with the experience (19 years) AND the vocation, study and apply for the starting positions as local public administrators. 
 
47. The local district position as local Major is granted to those reaching the highest scores among the other candidates. 

48. The best Majors and Governors are also progressively promoted towards a wider geographical area until one reaches the position as President (Head of the State) of the city/territory. 

49. The administrators that are not selected to promotion end their public career and should resume the administration of private enterprises.

50. In order to guarantee that the best Public Officer is selected, Artificial Inteligence would be used to develop and standarise a scoring system that compensate evenly the several variables involved in governing different geographical, sociological and economical areas. 

RELEASING THE BUDGET 
51. Smartcontract locked resources. 


LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
Lower camera: Scientific specialists:
52. Legislators must be professors/researchers in each specific area to be regulated, particularly experts in quantitatible research and conducting sample implementations before proposing laws that must be peer reviewed. 

53. In the same manner of the executive role, legislative officers are not popularly elected but selected and promoted within a generational scoring system of performance. 

54. Idealy Executive and legislative profesionals must be directly correlated/mirrored branches, therefore for a minister of transportation there must be a commission of transportation in the senate. 

Upper camera: Professionals on statistics. 
55. An elite group of profesionals in statistics will re-study the interrelated/corelated variables in order to forecast the implications to the general public of a new law considering multidisciplinary crossed effects of the other areas.
