# THE-BLOCKCHAIN-REPUBLIC

1. Block and Chain are words loaded with slavery connotations as in the 'striatted' agricultural/mining landfield/squarified urban aglomeration/barcoding/jailing.

2. Currently the term refers to ledgers for data/transfers within a mass datification process: 
absolutely everything including volume of air inhaled, daily composition of the human excrement and all sort of medical, intelectual, productivity variables correlated to enviromental, cultural and dietary factors will be milked/to/exhaustion. 

3. A 'sort of' excel/blockchain would be needed to register all these data/transactions since confirmed pregnacy until legal/biological death.  


4. This is a template for a dystopian ledger/control system and, by extension, a way to perpetuate the priviledges of the ultra high-net-worth individuals. 

5. The idea is to generate enough traction to signal escape routes to the natural corporative/monopolistic tendencies of these predictions. 


FIRST PART: "EVERY COUNTRY ON THE PLANET WORKS AS A LABORATORY FARM".

6. We killed all the other hominids and spread across the world due to be constantly forced to exile by militar sedentarists. 

7. The world has been working like islands divided by farms. 

8. The "current" dilemma went worse with the taxation to subordinated farms (robbery) exemplified in the Akkadian empire. 

9. Every "capital/provinces" system implies inneficient boureaucracy and corruption: basically a colonial model.

10. Additionally the project of an enciclopedic republic, guided by the illustration, was naturally controlled from the beginning by the sponsoring 'affluents' and corporations (nowdays). 

11. The popular election failed due to the lack of coordination between science, tax collection and budget execution. 

12. Notice than politics is the only area of human interaction where a generalist is choosen to do a very specific job which, outside of this irrational model, would be considered absurd: the best example would be, the person chosen to represent a country in the 100 meters race competition.

13. The problem is that models for evaluating standarized good governanze were never thought until now when artificial inteligence is exceling humans in every single imaginable category. 

14. The ideal template of a goverment management would imply the final goal of zero public officers. Automation. 

15. It is our responsibility as ideologists to study every country/farm and select/handpick from them the best proven policies (one by one) to construct a Frankenstein republic. 

16.After analysing the external debt to GDP ratio, we could conclude that a model based on a direct relationship between the household, the metropolis, the island/continent and the world would significantly reduce the money/loss via inefficiency.

A TRANSITORY MODEL-A SCHOLASTIC/GENERATIONAL/MERITOCRATIC TECHNOCRACY.

When we focus on gobernance we talk about positions.
Every position can be only held once within a career/promotion model. 
The final objective is to prevent structuraly that any individual with delirium of grandeur would be able to seize power. 

The farms are currently a system of linear exploitation to perpetuate stability within archaic models of supremasy and titulage (note how the word royal means both real/fact and kingship) while at the same time keep as many 'undesirables' outside of the borders.    
Outsiders, are useful as producers and consumers, but not as peers. 
The concept of 'kind' is as restricted as possible in terms of proximity in the biological evolution kingdom, country of origin, race, gender, age, religious, political and sport affiliations.
This goes with the fact that people are forced to identify themselves within these categories despite not wanting to be labeled or disminished.
The restriction of reality/check images/facts is essential: the animals being killed, the indigenous peoples being killed and the local environmental activists being killed must be censored and silenced in order to keep the overall streamline model working. 

Algorythms are used to maximize the time spent under entertaintment. 





CORPORATIVE STRUCTURES: THE OPPOSITE OF THE DISNEY MODEL

Imagine all the team in the production of a movie or videogame (including extras, cleaning and security personal) gets paid in equity and loyalties proportionally according to their contributions. 

Imagine that cleaning and security personal of Amazon was paid in equity and loyalties 

An economic model debt free.

Your loyalties last during all your lifetime and they can't be alienated.

Companies can't auction more than 49% of their equity as funding strategy and therefore 51% should always remain creditable to the employees proportional to their contributions.

CROSSED/CHECKED TAXBOOK
Avoiding tax dummy companies 

Taxation will be executed according to the enviromental and health impacts of the supply chain/operation of the company. 
For example: a company selling packaged food would have to pay for both the sugar (or sweetened) content (and all other ingredientes linked to health diseases) and the plastic used in the wrapping. 
This tax would be then be transferred to the customer who would then be able to avoid this tax by buying fresh raw ingredientes with a tax related only for the "livecycle assessment" (an improved/more detailed alternative to the 'food miles'). 

Notice how under this system there are people paying zero taxes: households off the grid, growing vegetables with a single property/family business. Using transportation without fossil fuels
