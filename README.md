# THE-BLOCKCHAIN-REPUBLIC

## INTRODUCTION: "ESCAPE ROUTES"

1. Block and Chain are words loaded with slavery connotations: mining/landfield/squarified urban aglomeration/barcoding/jailing (see the essay 'the smooth and the striated').

2. Currently the term refers to ledgers for transactions within a mass datification process: 
absolutely all sort of medical, intelectual, productivity variables correlated to enviromental, cultural and dietary factors are being milked/to/exhaustion in order to amplify generational priviledges of the ultra high-net-worth individuals. 

3. A parent ledger is being deployed  by mega tech corporations in order to register all the data since confirmed pregnacy until legal/biological death (disposition of the corpse and distribution of the belongings of the person who just passed).  

4. This is a template for a dystopian control system based on algorithms.  

5. The idea is to signal escape routes to ongoing/natural corporative/monopolistic tendencies: an algorithm against the algorithm.

## FIRST PART: "EVERY COUNTRY ON THE PLANET WORKS AS A LABORATORY FARM"

6. We killed all the other hominids and spread across the world due to be constantly forced to exile by militar sedentarists. 

7. The world has been working like islands divided by farms. 

8. The "current" dilemma went worse with the taxation to military subordinated territories (robbery) exemplified in the Akkadian empire. 

9. Every "capital/provinces" system implies inneficient boureaucracy and corruption: basically a colonial model.

10. The present proposed republic is a long term sustainable template for trans-continental and interconnected metropolitan areas organized by commuting patterns and river basins.

.
## SECOND PART: "NO POPULAR ELECTION"

11. The project of an enciclopedic republic, guided by the illustration, was naturally controlled from the beginning by the sponsoring 'affluents' and corporations (nowdays). 

12. The popular election is highly inefficient due to the lack of coordination between science, tax collection and budget execution. 

13. Notice than politics is the only area of human interaction where a generalist is choosen to do a very specific job which, outside of this irrational model, would be considered absurd: the best example would be to chose by popular election the person performing an open heart surgery.

14. Models for evaluating standarized good governance were never thought until now when artificial inteligence is exceling humans in every single imaginable category. 

15. The ideal template of governmental management would imply the final goal of zero public officers: Automation. 

16. It is our responsibility as ideologists to study every country/farm and select/handpick from them the best proven policies (one by one) to construct a republic with the best features of existing republics and added features currently yet to be implemented.

.
## THIRD PART: "A TRANSITORY MODEL-A SCHOLASTIC/GENERATIONAL/MERITOCRATIC TECHNOCRACY"

17. The fudamental principle of the republic is the elimination of popular election and the impossibility of appointing others to public roles.

18. The final objective is to prevent structuraly that any individual with delirium of grandeur would be able to seize power. 

19. In order to do so, we have created a series of positions organized by career paths in ascending grades and generationally. 

20. Every position can be only held once and it is not possible to enter another public branch. 

21. Initial public positions require that the candidates have already undergone a generation (19 years) of experience in the private sector, but this experience just starting being accrued after reaching 19 years old (the legal age to enter adulthood). 

22. For practical purposes one generation is divided in four periods (The number of years a position would be held before being promoted or finalizing the public service).
 
23. 19 years represents a cycle of the sun and moon approximate reset and an approximated middle point to adulthood in several countries.

## FOURTH PART: "ENVIRONMENTALLY ORIENTED SUSTAINABLE GOVERNANCE" 
### (THE 'PARIS AGREEMENT' MADE A MATHEMATICAL FORMULA FOR TAXATION/INCENTIVES)
Things that work on scientific basis, like banning the use of lead in the gasoline or the usage of Chlorofluorocarbons are the best examples on how coordination on proven facts is possible and necessary. 

24. The republic aim to extend the concept of 'kind' into a wider perspective, challenging traditional restricted models where only other selected humans are considered as such in relation to their proximity in terms of biological evolutionary kingdom, aesthetics, health conditions, country of origin, race, gender, age, religious, political and sport affiliations.

25. In the Republic the hyerarchical order of rights starts with the clean water and air being the top priority of any policy, followed by natural parks, native animals, plants and indigenous peoples.  

26. Geographical/political areas would be alighned to river basins.

27. The areas between contiguous territories configure ecologically protected areas where 'rivers are born' and both border territories agree to preserve an 'Excluyent economic zone' (the opposite of the 'exclusive economic zone' for seas) where would be agreed to avoid any human intervention and/or minimize the human impact via relocating human settlers and building bridges for animals. 

28. Tributary river systems serve to track responsibilities and compensations to the city states inmediate under them regarding the plastic and chemical polution in the water. 

29. For example: Uganda must pay South Sudan, for the polution discharged in the Nile, while South Sudan and Ethiopia, must pay Sudan for the pollution discharged in the Nile and at the same time, Sudan must compensate Egypt for the pollution discharged, while Egypt must pay the other territories for the pollution discharged to the mediterranean sea. 
The amount to be paid will represent the exact amount that it would cost to heal the damages.

30. Notice how local goverments should therefore seek to transfer this accountability to corporations and urban water discharges to the river systems and other environmental damages like gas emissions, noise pollution, etc. 

31. By doing so, corporations will effectively and unavoidably, transfer these costs to the final customers, as price increases: facilitating the reconsideration of their daily decisions based on real environmentally accountability.

## CORPORATIVE STRUCTURES: "TRIPARTITE OWNERSHIP MODEL"
45. All companies are at the same time Capitalists (48% is granted as non voting shares to investors), state owned (1% non voting shares are owned by the state accounting service) and private (51% is owned by the employees of the company proportionate to their contributions and every employee is the facto share holder). 

46. The intention behind these policies is to focus the attention of investors in financing start ups as a road towards wealth. 
 
47. Accounting will be public in real time per transaction, and financial reports will be publicly shared on a daily basis. 

48. Once an employee leaves the company his corresponding equity will be purchased from the public shares and the internal shares will be burned in order to rebalance the equity among the updated employees. 

49. The total liabilities of a company can't exceed ten times the net income AND/OR ten times the tangigle shareholder's equity (Shareholders equity minus the total intangible assets).

.
## COPYRIGHTS, INDUSTRIAL AND DESIGN PATENTS ARE LINKED TO THE CREATOR VIA BLOCKCHAIN
Nobody would be able to transfer or sell these rights. 

Corporations can't own patents, only individuals can do and they last a lifetime. After passing, the patent charges will be stop being collected and therefore distributed to the remaining total population. 

Creators are paid in royalties, revenue commission and other residuals proportionate to their contributions. 

29. Any person participating in the production of any product or service gets paid in equity and royalties proportionally according to their contributions. 

30. Your royalties last during all your lifetime and can't be alienated.

31. Once you have died, the royalties and patent rights, goes to the entire human population, configuring a minimum salary background for everyone in the republic.

.
## TAXES

32. No income tax. 

33. All revenue are collected via spending (Value Added Tax) tiered from (1) raw agricultural products of local extraction without packaging (lowest tax/related to the transpostation and leftover treatment), to (2) all consumer discretionary purchases (cars, household appliances, jewlery, watches, yachts).

34. Taxation will be executed according to the enviromental and health impacts of the supply chain/operation of the companies/transactions services/products. 

35. For example: a company selling packaged food would have to pay for both the sugar (or sweetened) content (and all other ingredientes linked to health diseases), the plastic used in the wrapping and the impact of the transportation from raw materials to consumer. 

36. A transportation company and factories have to pay for the gas emitions, of its operations, etc. 

37. This tax would be then be transferred to the customer via a taxation on the "livecycle assessment" (an improved/more detailed alternative to the 'food miles'). 

38. Recreational drugs like smartphones ('social networks/gaming platforms), alcohol, cigarretes, sugar and cannabis are legal and taxed in a way that is sustainable and proportionate to the health system/managing the implications of its usage. 

39. Fines: traffic fines, like speeding and other traffic violations and court fines, must be calculated based on the salary of the violator. 

40. Custom tax under the Harmmonized tariff system. 

41. No inheritance tax.

.
## SERVICES TAX

39. There's a progressive taxation system/subsidy: minimul vital amount of water essential as drinking water 3,7 liters plus 7,3 liters needed to flush the toilet would be free per person in every household. 

40. A second level of water needed for cooking and human and household maintainance will be charge at cost of production. 

41. In a third level, the consumption will be subtiered, where greater amount consumption would be taxed at a greater rate (with the intention to discourage waste, reduce overconsumption and on contrary incentivize self moderation).

.
## PROPERTY TAX: "Base of the concept of life state" 
### Residencial Property tax
42. Every citizen pays zero tax for the place where he lives, represented in his own one bedroom, one bathroom, one kitchen and dinning room. 

43. The system is planned as a live/cycle of natural upsizing and downsizing proportions. 

a. Entry level housing, usually apartments used by young adults single college students or widowed pensioners.

b. Couple housing is an intermediate level of housing where rights are legally splitted bewteen the dwellers and constitute de facto financial partnership during the rental time. 

c. Family housing is the ultimate, larger protected ownership strategy including a backward, garage and garden.

44. Special considerations have been taken in order to grant medical attention to pregnant women, newly borns and elders by placing their residences closer to these facilities. 

45. The size of this residencial property exempt from taxes is determined by the "the median size of a lot for new construction". 

46. The taxes increase by 10% progressively with the number of properties owned, up to 9 properties, where the taxation reached 90%, making the investment practicaly inprofitable. 

47. Every residential rental is considered de facto a rent-to-own contract in benefit of the person renting.
 
### Agricultural, Commercial and Industrial Property Tax
48. A similar tiered taxation system is applicable to agricultural, industrial and commercial land, considering the total percentage of land available within the geographic territory/the river basin. 

49. Corporations can't own houses neither they can own industrial, commercial or agricultural land, they can only rent it, being the most profitable strategy to rent it directly from several of its employees or investors, as the first property owned by them outside of their residencial houses.

## COUNTER TAXATION:

50. Financial payments will be granted for processing neighboors black waters and organic leftovers, plastics, glass, metals, electronics, etc. in order to reintroduce the materials to the productive chain.
-
.
## EXECUTIVE BRANCH
51. The fundamental training for all professional private administrators is essential to guarantee that, only those with the experience (19 years) AND the vocation, study and apply for the starting positions as local public administrators. 
 
52. All candidates must select one of the faculties assigned to the career path alined to one of the executive ministeries. 

53. The faculties guarantee that the graduate is updated with professional international standards before assigning a diploma after a cycle (4 years and 9 months). 

54. The certification is granted by peer reviewed professional associations. 

55. Any graduated person of any age would be able to study public administration from all the materials provided by the previous test cycles and further materials available. 

56. The first possition available to be filled is the local secretary of education, health, defense, etc. (all the different ministery/careers of the executive power in the territory).   

57. The candidate optaining the highest score, within each faculty/ministry career path, in the test gets assigned the position.

53. The three runner ups, get a contract to develop the next cycle test (4 years 9 months), being responsible each one to formulate 33 questions, 4 option/multiple selection, that must be peer reviewed by the other two companions, must keep, absolute secrecy, and the questions will be public on the next assesstment day while the next generation of candidates aspire to the positions in real time, online, TV transmitted tests.

54. Ending the cycle, the secretaries can aspire to two public positions: Local Major Administrator (compiting with all the local secretaries of the other fields) AND/OR District secretary (compiting with all the other local secretaries within the same field).  

56. The local district position as local Major is granted to those reaching the highest scores among the other candidates. 

57. The same system of 3 runner ups developing the next test cycle, is applied throughtout all the positions.  

48. The best Majors and Governors are also progressively promoted towards a wider geographical area until one reaches the position as President (Head of the State) of the river basin/territory. 

49. The administrators that are not selected to promotion end their public career and should resume the administration of private enterprises.

50. In order to guarantee that the best Public Officer is selected, Artificial Inteligence would be used to develop and standarise a scoring system that compensate evenly the several variables involved in governing different geographical, sociological and economical areas.

.
## RELEASING THE BUDGET 
51. Publicly disclosed smart contracts based on locked resources creditable only to purchases in open bids. 
-
.
## LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
### LOWER CAMERA: SCIENTIFIC SPECIALIST:
52. Legislators must be commitees (3, 5 or 7 members?) of professors/researchers in each specific area to be regulated, particularly experts in quantitatible research and conducting sample implementations before proposing laws that must be peer reviewed. 

53. In the same manner of the executive role, legislative officers are not popularly elected but promoted within a generational scoring system of performance. 

54. Executive and legislative profesionals must be directly correlated/mirrored branches, therefore for a minister of transportation there must be a commission of transportation in a congress of specialist, etc. 
-
.
### UPPER CAMERA: COORELATION/STATISTICS COMMITEE. 

55. A council, (3, 5, 7 members?) group of profesionals in quantitatible research, correlated variables and statistics will re-study the proposed laws  in order to forecast the implications to the general public; considering multidisciplinary crossed effects of the other areas. 

56. Such positions are optained by a public career in the field, via progressive promotion. 

57. The ethical effects of the scholastic generational technocracy would be equal to the median ethical awareness of the population being represented.
